# 💵 ExpenseSplitter

ExpenseSplitter is a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) implemented API, meticulously crafted in C#. This project serves as a vivid showcase of how Clean Architecture priciples can be applied, with an emphasis on creating a robust and scalable solution for managing expenses among users. The API allows users to create settlements, add participants, and manage expenses with flexible splitting options, ensuring a comprehensive expense settlement system.

# 🦩 Features / patterns

1. Bold split into: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
2. **Domain layer**: Entities, ValueObjects, DomainEvents, Domain Servies, Strongly typed IDs
3. **Application Layer**: CQRS using MediatR with ICommand, IQuery, ICommandHandler, IQueryHandler abstractions, Logging for ICommandHandler, Validators with handling middleware, Result-driven communication, Idempotent/duplicated request handling, Railway-oriented programming (showcase)
4. **Presentation Layer**: Minimal API with Swagger documentation, Trace ID middleware, Rate limiting.
5. **Infrastructure Layer**: EF Core (DbContext, Entity mapping, DB migrations, Repositories), Authentication & Authorization, Database migrations
6. **Testing**: Automated testing in CI, code coverage collection and history comparison, Architecture tests, testcontainers integration testing
7. **CI/CD**: Dependabot integration, auto weekly nuget packages updates, Trivy scanning, SonarQube static-code analysis, automatic semantic-release, docker image publishing
7. Docker support with docker-compose orchestration
8. **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration for comprehensive monitoring, tracing, and logging with Grafana Cloud


# 🛹 Big picture

To let you quickly understand the domain and relationships of the project entities I decided to create a class diagram.

# 👨‍💻 Development

## Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Copy the example environment file and configure it with your values:

```sh
cp api/.env.example api/.env
```

## Run API (backend)

```sh
dotnet run --project api/src/ExpenseSplitter.Api.Presentation/ExpenseSplitter.Api.Presentation.csproj
```

## Run App (frontend)

```sh
cd app && npm run dev
```

## Start dependencies

```sh
docker-compose up -d expensesplitter-db expensesplitter-idp expensesplitter-cache
```

## Create db migration

```sh
dotnet ef migrations add --startup-project api/src/ExpenseSplitter.Api.Presentation --project api/src/ExpenseSplitter.Api.Infrastructure ...
```
